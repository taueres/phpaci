# PHPaci: PHP Application Completion Interface
**Warning. PHPaci is still being developed: it is unstable and some features are not completed yet.**

PHPaci is a tool for exposing autocomplete suggestions for PHP7 scripts.

It uses the internal *PHP Abstract Syntax Tree* introduced by PHP7.

PHPaci is a Server API of the PHP interpreter. This means that it must be included into the PHP source codebase before being compiled.
However compiled standalone versions of PHPaci will be distributed soon.
